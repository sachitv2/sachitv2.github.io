    "\n",
    "The International Finance Corporation (IFC) Investment Dashboard provides a comprehensive exploration of IFC's financial activities, focusing on key dimensions such as geographical distribution, sectoral preferences, and temporal trends. This dashboard is a collaborative effort by Deeksha Manohar Rao and Sachit Vasudev, leveraging the Altair visualization library. The primary dataset, sourced from IFC, offers a detailed record of approved investments, including industry sectors, countries, and monetary values. The visualizations aim to empower users, especially those new to data analysis, to gain insights into the patterns and impact of IFC investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Geographical and Sectoral Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first section of the dashboard revolves around the geographical distribution of IFC investments. The heatmap chart provides an immediate overview of the total IFC investment across different countries and industries. Viewers can interactively explore the data by selecting specific regions or industry sectors using the brush tool. Two linked bar charts dynamically update in response to the user's selection, offering a detailed breakdown of investments by country and industry. This approach allows users to discern patterns and understand which countries and sectors are prominent in IFC's investment portfolio.\n",

    "Contextual Visualization with MIGA:\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide a broader context and enhance the comparative analysis, the dashboard incorporates visualizations from the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The MIGA contextual visualization complements the IFC dashboard by illustrating investment data from another multilateral institution. The integrated charts showcase the geographical distribution and sectoral preferences for both IFC and MIGA, facilitating a side-by-side comparison. Additionally, the time series chart for MIGA investments over fiscal years offers insights into the temporal dynamics of both institutions. This comparative approach enables users to draw nuanced conclusions about the unique strategies and impacts of IFC and MIGA in the global financial landscape.\n",
